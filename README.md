# strandomizr
The stata version of randomizr. All necessary files (ado and sthlp) are in the strandomizr directory. To install strandomizr in Stata use the following command: 

``` r
net install strandomizr, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeclareDesign/strandomizr/master/) replace
```

The unit tests folder contains a series of do files that error-check the functions. The vignette directory contains a do file that generates an html using the function markdoc in Stata. The vignette provides a walkthrough for how to use the various random assignment functions in strandomizr.
